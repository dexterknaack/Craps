INSTRUCTOR COMMENTS
===================

This is awesome, Dexter. Great game flow, and you implemented
both the default Yes/No feature as suggested in the 
handout, and also included the graphical dice option.

I suppose it's a bit of an overstatement to call them
graphical dice, since they're really just characters arranged
to represent a die. Have you given any thought to creating
a Processing version of this program? It'd be great to see
some actually dice spinning across the table...!

In the meantime, keep up the great work!

SCORE: 55/50
